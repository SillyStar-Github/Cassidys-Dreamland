# Cassidy's Dreamland
A set of addons and modifications to PvZ: Fusion that create my ideal game experience.

## Installation

1. Install the latest version of PvZ: Fusion that supports the mod pack. The current supported version is: **3.1.1**. You can find official downloads for these versions in the [**PvZ: Fusion Fans Discord server**](https://discord.gg/pvzfusion).
2. Download the latest [**.zip file release**](https://github.com/SillyStar-Github/Cassidys-Dreamland/releases/latest) of the mod in the releases tab.
3. Extract all the folders and files from the **PvZ: Fusion download** into a new folder.
4. Extract all the folder and files from the **mod release download** into the same folder. The "MelonLoader" folder, "Mods" folder, and "version.dll" file should be right next to the "PlantsVsZombiesRH.exe" file.
5. Launch the game and enjoy!
